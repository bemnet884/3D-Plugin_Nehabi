## Usage  

### Embedding Models:  
Use the `[multiviewer]` shortcode to add a 3D model to your content.  

**Syntax:**  
```plaintext  
[multiviewer type="TYPE" src="MODEL_URL" width="WIDTH" height="HEIGHT" background="BACKGROUND" border="BORDER" shadow="SHADOW" padding="PADDING"]  
```  

**Parameters:**  
- `type` (required): Platform type (`spline` or `sketchfab`).  
- `src` (required): URL of the 3D model or embed iframe.  
- `width` (optional): Viewer width (default: `100%`).  
- `height` (optional): Viewer height (default: `500px`).  
- `background` (optional): Background color (default: `transparent`).  
- `border` (optional): Border style (default: `none`).  
- `shadow` (optional): Box shadow (default: `none`).  
- `padding` (optional): Padding (default: `0`).  

### Examples:  

#### Spline Model:  
```plaintext  
[multiviewer type="spline" src="https://my.spline.design/molang3dcopy-fcfc5f52ce2d056f6bf215b94f76c0da/" width="100%" height="500px" background="transparent"]  
```  

#### Sketchfab Model:  
```plaintext  
[multiviewer type="sketchfab" src="https://sketchfab.com/models/example-id/embed" width="800px" height="600px" border="1px solid #000"]  
```

## Admin Dashboard Features  

The plugin includes a user-friendly admin page to generate shortcodes:  
1. Choose the model type (Spline or Sketchfab).  
2. Enter the model URL.  
3. Adjust viewer properties like width, height, background, border, shadow, and padding.  
4. Generate the shortcode instantly.

## Known Limitations  

- **Current Support**: Spline and Sketchfab models only.  
- **Excluded Formats**: Local GLTF/GLB files are not supported yet, due to:  
  1. **Zip File Handling**: Uploading and extracting zip files containing GLTF/GLB models requires additional plugins and adds complexity in:  
     - Parsing and processing file contents.  
     - Ensuring secure and seamless extraction workflows.  
  2. **Security Concerns**: Risks associated with file uploads.  
  3. **Performance Issues**: Potential resource consumption on shared hosting environments.  
  4. **Time Constraints**: Prioritizing stable features for this release.  
---

## Future Updates  

- **GLTF/GLB Support**: Plan to enable local file uploads and rendering in future versions.  
- **Enhanced Customization**: Additional iframe properties for advanced control.  

---

## Troubleshooting  

- **Model not displaying**: Ensure the model URL is correct and accessible.  
- **Background issues (Spline)**: Disable the background in Spline before embedding (refer to the [walkthrough](https://app.supademo.com/demo/cm4nxyod9112uwf11ol7ugfuy)).  

---

## Changelog
